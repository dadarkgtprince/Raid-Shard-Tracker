# Raid-Shard-Tracker

Track your shard pulls and see the percentages for a chance to pull a legendary from that shard. Enable 2x checkbox if 2x is active, disable if not. If you pull a legendary or forgot to track, you can reset and start the tracking over.

This does *NOT* link to the game and is a 100% complete manual process
